# To do list 

## Trustctl script

- import code from GitLab into a project (private), return UUID of the project
- create SBOM for source code projects

- function to create new project in TC/Teams
- function to create SBOM for image
- function to import SBOM of image to the project, wait for vulnerability scan to end
 
- function to return summary of vulnerabilities (severe=x, high=y...)
- function to return risk score

## GitLab pipeline

- compare summary of vulnerabilities before and after new scan/deploy and alert about new vulnerability
- deny deployment of non compliant images

## Other Qs

- TC Teams architecture - which databases it stores information in
- How is the information (metadata, project details) in TC Teams protected from tampering
- What are examples of policies (conditions upon which notarization is allowed); 
is there a default setting/set of conditions others are using; generally what are the set of conditions used in other companies
eg. 1 critical vulnerability
- Create a list of possible policies (eg. what goes into manual review)
- Is it possible to see on FE the tlevel of subproject?
